# Intrusion Detection System with ML/DL
This repository contains the code for the project "Development and Implementation of Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection System". This repository proposes a Python implementation of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning models. The system is designed to identify and classify network intrusions or attacks, providing a robust defense against potential security threats. This project modifies the work from Essam Mohamed to train models using UNSW-NB15. 

## Credits
This codebase is based on the work of Essam Mohamed, available on Kaggle. The original code focused on building an Intrusion Detection System using machine learning and deep learning techniques, using the NSL-KDD dataset.
